<h1>The Troubles<br />
of Biddy</h1>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">"Oh dear," sighed old Biddy, just under her breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I really am troubled and worried to death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For months I have thought of a family, dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To gladden my heart, and to live with me here.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">"But daily I find that my plans are upset,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all I can do is to sit here and fret&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I haven't a sign of an egg in my nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though some I have laid are as good as the best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">"I&nbsp;scolded last night when my mistress came near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But though she was bitten, she seemed not to fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She only said, 'Biddy, what are you about?'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then through the doorway she simply passed out.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">For surely to be a good mother I'd try;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although I would see that they did as I said!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Biddy, in sorrow and grief hung her head.<br /></span>

<span class="i0cap">So deep was the longing of poor Biddy's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She felt that with life she was ready to part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But glancing about in her trouble and pain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She saw that her mistress was coming again;<br /></span>

<span class="i0cap">And noting the basket she held in her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old Biddy thought quickly "she can't understand,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "what is she doing?" exclaimed in surprise;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For out of the nest Biddy felt herself rise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">As Biddy stood resting her poor weary legs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She saw that the basket contained shining eggs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mistress with care placed them all in the nest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Biddy to snuggle beneath her warm breast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">Now Biddy was happy; her burden was gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her troubles had vanished, she felt she had none:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, planning away in her little straw bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No thoughts of complaining came into her head.<br /></span>

<span class="i0cap">She looked from the window each morning at dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pictures of rapture were constantly drawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, out on the lawn near a little old shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were dishes and troughs where the chickens were fed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">And Biddy thought wisely, "These things I shall use;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The largest and neatest are what I shall choose."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never a thought did this wise mother take<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of danger, or trouble, in St. Mary's lake.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">How happy she was when the first sounds were heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the bright downy heads her soft feathers stirred!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But what is the matter with each little nose?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She said in amazement, "And what ails their toes?"<br /></span>

<span class="i2">For none of her children could really say peep.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And leaving the road side she screamed, "Of all things!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0cap">Her babies were all in the watering trough,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Said, "Come, let us travel," and there a trip planned.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"In the lake I'm sure you will meet with some harm!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">But to cry, and protest, and urge them to come<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seemed all of no use, for they would not go home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Biddy exclaimed to herself in disgust,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"To stand this I cannot, and leave them I must!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">The evening shades gathered that night in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wind sung most softly a sweet lula-by;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">She found they were ducklings, and such could not own.<br /></span>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
